Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Analyzed Dataset
Data Dictionary
INFORMATION ABOUT THE DATASET:
    The tidy dataset described in this Code Book was created using the following files:
    + ‘features_info.txt’: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
+ ‘activity_labels.txt’: Links the class labels with their activity name.
+ ‘train/X_train.txt’: Training set.
+ ‘train/y_train.txt’: Training labels.
+ ‘test/X_test.txt’: Test set.
+ ‘test/y_test.txt’: Test labels.
The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.
+ ‘train/subject_train.txt’: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
Note: Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
| subject | 2 |
    | — | — | Subject Label + 1..30 .Unique Identifier assigned for each subject who performed the activity for each window sample.

| activity_names | 18
| — | — | Activity Label
+ Six activities performed by each subject wearing a smartphone. Converted from its original value (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) to:
    WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING

Respectively.

NOTES FOR THE FEATURES ONWARD:
    The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix ‘t’ to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the ‘f’ to indicate frequency domain signals).
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern
‘-XYZ’ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions:
    tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The mean (mean()) and standard deviation (std()) of the above signals were then estimated and selected. Finally, the average of each signal for each activity and each subject were calculated for the following set of variables:
